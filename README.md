Selection Sort
This repository contains an implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in Python.

About Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the beginning.

Algorithm Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Usage
To use the selection sort implementation, clone this repository and run the Python script provided.

bash
git clone https://github.com/RosmeoP/selection-sort.git
cd selection-sort
python selection_sort.py
Example
Suppose you have an array:

Python
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
selection_sort(arr)
print(arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
